# Atomico + Tailwindcss + Estack

This example shows the use of the plugin for postcss [@UpperCod/postcss-import](https://github.com/UpperCod/postcss-import) incorporated by default in [EStack](https://github.com/uppercod/estack), to illustrate the use of the plugin I have generated this example that shows how to use [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/components/buttons) with Atomico.

[**Atomico**](https://github.com/atomicojs/atomico) is an amazing library of only 2.9KB for creating webcomponents just using functions.
